# Project Part 2: First Sprint
## Sprint Planning
|Task|Our Submission|
|-------|-------------|
| Document your sprint forecast and rationale in README | Our first sprint has three stories totalling 10 points. These stories were selected based on how they will satisfy the preconditions of getting our infrastructure set up and getting a user logged in. As our first sprint we don't have any prior evidence for how many points we can do in a sprint, so we came to a conservative consensus at 10. |
| Pull appropriate stories into sprint backlog | All team members are developers and all team members participated. <br> https://github.com/Best-Team-Forever/ClassProject/blob/main/doc/SprintBacklog.jpg |
| Ensure stories are right-sized | Based on our estimating activity we believe our first three stories are estimated correctly at [5, 3, 2] |
| Decompose stories into tasks | We put our tasks in the story description. See screenshot: <br> https://github.com/Best-Team-Forever/ClassProject/blob/main/doc/SubTaskBreakout.jpg|
| Set up a kanban board for sprint backlog | We are using Jira for the kanban board. See screenshot: <br> https://github.com/Best-Team-Forever/ClassProject/blob/main/doc/kanban.jpg |

# Project Part 3: Second Sprint
## Sprint Planning
|Task| Our Submission|
|-----------|-------------|
| Document sprint forecast and rationale | Sprint forecast: We forecasted 10 user story points for this sprint based on yesterday's weather. Rationale: The first item on our backlog is our Sprint Retrospective. We prioritized and pulled stories to our Sprint 2 based on the value to the stakeholders, technical dependensies, and feasibility. Our main stakeholder, Dr. Brooke Breen, the radiologist wants to be able to upload mammograms in DICOM format - this is a new feature to our current image upload capabilities and second in our sprint backlog. Dr. Breen wants the mammogram analyzed more accurately hence, improving the image analysis model is high priority and next on our product backlog. This is followed by improving analysis result page to enhance user experince and adding the feature for our radiologist, Dr. Breen, to add comments. |

In this review we presented our product demo, shared our vision of the product, and got valuable feedback on our MVP. We incorporated this feedback to improve our product during this current sprint and adjusted our product backlog for our next sprint.
